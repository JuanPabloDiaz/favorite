Players take on the role of V, a cyber-enhanced mercenary, and embark on a fight for survival filled with story-defining decisions, action-packed gameplay, and unforgettable characters, including rockerboy Johnny Silverhand (played by Keanu Reeves) and FIA sleeper agent Solomon Reed (played by Idris Elba).\n\nThis new release is the perfect way to experience every story of the dark future; it also contains the free Update 2.0, which overhauled many of the game’s systems, introducing dynamic skill trees, high-octane vehicle combat, and enhanced enemy and police AI — as well as adding new weapons, vehicles, and clothes. The release is bolstered with a set of previously released digital goodies available as part of the “My Rewards” program, available to all who register.",

In G.O.A.T. Career Mode, players must build fight hype to gain fans, earn cash to train at new gyms, and create heated rivalries with other fighters to capture the world's attention.

In addition, an all-new suite of customizable multiplayer modes let you and your friends get into the Octagon and face off in fast, fun, intense pick-up-and-play bouts where a highlight-reel knockout is always only one strike away and victory happens in the blink of an eye.",
