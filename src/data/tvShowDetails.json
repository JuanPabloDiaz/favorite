This year, Will hip-hops over to the same prep school as Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro) and starts scoping out colleges. While Will tries to work his mojo on reluctant Monique (Kim Fields, Living Single), Hilary (Karyn Parsons) breaks into show business and learns some hard lessons. But the kids aren’t the only ones riding life’s highs and lows. Philip (James Avery) jumps into the race for superior court judge, opposing his sleazy but powerful former mentor (Sherman Hemsley, The Jeffersons). And Vivian (Janet Hubert-Whitten) surprises everyone by announcing that she’s pregnant! Also appearing in this hilarious and poignant season are Oprah Winfrey, Vanessa Williams (Ugly Betty), comic D.L. Hughley, singer Tom Jones and boxer Riddick Bowe. All 24 episodes are fresh — and ready for your enjoyment.",

          "overview": "Charming and cocky Will continues his reign as The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in the fourth fast-paced season of this hit family comedy with heart. Will (Will Smith) and Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro) are living large at college — even though they live in their family’s pool house. When they’re not hunting the honeys, like the superhot Jackie (Tyra Banks), the boys pledge a fraternity, where Will finds out that racism cuts both ways. At home, Will sneaks the dieting Philip (James Avery) some snacks, not realizing he’s endangering his uncle’s life. And Ashley (Tatyana Ali) breaks out of her childhood shell in a big way by undergoing an extremely sexy makeover, exploring the dating world and demanding some “Respect” from her parents by belting out the classic song. Donald Trump, Hugh Hefner, Dick Clark, Ben Vereen (Roots), Robert Guillaume (Benson), Pam Grier (Jackie Brown), jazzman Branford Marsalis and Boys II Men guest star in this laugh-filled 26-episode season of the freshest show around.",

All that romance must be contagious, because Carlton finds his soul sister through online dating. Unfortunately, that’s only half right. It’s Hilary. And there’s a lot more than love going on as Will grapples with a big orange whale, a mobster, a bear, Jay Leno, Lisa’s cantankerous dad, and in one of the series’ most memorable episodes, a bullet with his name on it. Get ready for laugh-out-loud fun!",

In the summer of 2008, the Food Network stopped re-running the series and rolled out a completely overhauled website omitting all but a single reference to Anthony Bourdain from March 2008 entitled, \"Anthony Bourdain's Rant\", tagged under Food Network topics \"vegetables\" and \"simmer,\" likely due to the emergence of Bourdain's similarly themed current series, No Reservations, on sister network Travel Channel. Questar Entertainment released a DVD box set of A Cook's Tour on DVD in January 2012. Early versions of this DVD box set are missing the episode TB1A04, Eating on the Mekong. Replacement DVDs are available from Questar starting in late February, 2012. As of March, 2012 episodes of A Cook's Tour have begun airing on the Travel Channel.",

The hour-long show premiered on March 2, 2009, and is hosted by actor, comedian and performer Jimmy Fallon, an alumnus of Saturday Night Live. Hip hop/neo soul band The Roots serve as the show's house band, and Steve Higgins is the show's announcer.\n\nThe third incarnation of the Late Night franchise originated by David Letterman, the program originates from NBC Studio 6B in the GE Building at 30 Rockefeller Center in New York City. The show typically opens with a brief monologue from Fallon, followed by a comedy \"desk piece,\" as well as prerecorded segments and audience competitions. The next segment is devoted to a celebrity interview, with guests ranging from actors and musicians to media personalities and political figures. The show then closes with either a musical or comedy performance. The show frequently employs digital media into its comedy, which has become crucial to its success. Fallon has been appointed to become the next host of The Tonight Show, where he will succeed the current host Jay Leno at the conclusion of the 2014 Winter Olympics, with fellow SNL alum Seth Meyers slated to replace Fallon.",

As their junkyard journeys continue, the pickers rummage through ramshackle school buses, a burned storage building, forgotten barns, salvage yards, and rust heaps in search of what they call \"good junk.\" They come across an item they've never seen before, place bets on what it actually is, and get a surprising assessment from the appraiser. They encounter a mother and daughter who catch the picking bug and give the guys a run for their money. And with nerves of steel, they try to strike deals with people who are often reluctant to part with their possessions. Meanwhile, back in Iowa, Danielle Colby Cushman holds down the fort at Antique Archaeology.",

In subsequent episodes, the duo will \"pick\" a speedy cycle car, crafted from the wing tank of a WWII-era plane; the work of iconic painter Norman Rockwell; a 350-pound taxidermy African elephant head, which they ultimately swap in exchange for a vintage photo booth and jukebox; and two coin-operated \"peek-a-boo\" strip poker machines from the 1950's.

They find rare cars and motorcycles that you won't find back in the states but they aren't able to seal every negotiation since they have to factor in the exchange rate between Euros and dollars, and the cost of shipping everything back home. Back in the states, Mike and Frank will once again haggle over a slew of interesting historic items and meet quirky and interesting characters. From rare Bonnie and Clyde memorabilia to a Bass Guitar that may have belonged to Bill Black, a legendary musician who played with Elvis, to a typewriter that supposedly was lent to Albert Einstein.

In the season opener, Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys shows interest in a vintage Chet Atkins Gretsch guitar that Mike stumbled across in South Carolina. In upcoming episodes, Mike and Frank cover new territory, picking in New Mexico for the first time ever. It wouldn't be American Pickers without amazing classic cars, and this season features two particularly rare ones: a 1954 Red Nash Healey Coupe and a 1954 Grey Nash Healey Coupe. Also coming up, the guys find a building chock full of Star Wars memorabilia including a life-sized Storm Trooper and Yoda, causing Frank to geek out. A lot is at stake when Frank makes a big bet with Mike: If Mike can down six dozen oysters then Frank has to shave his beard.",

        "overview": "When Billy starts taking pictures with a camera found in Grim's trunk, Grim tells him that is an Underworld's True-heart Camera, which shows the real essence of a person's heart. When Mandy takes Irwin's picture, it is revealed that he is actually half-good and half-evil. Irwin explains that although he was born evil, his dad taught him about love and respect, and he had a change of heart. Upon knowing this, and against her own wishes, Mandy also experiences a painful change, turning good and kind-hearted. Mandy and Irwin finally share a romantic kiss in this episode, but it makes Mandy revert to her old dark and sinister self, which was Irwin's true intention, as he likes her just the way she is.",
