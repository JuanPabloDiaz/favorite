    <p class="mb-4">
      Welcome to my personal curation of favorites — a carefully crafted collection of the books,
      movies, TV shows, games, artists, and podcasts that have shaped my taste and sparked my
      curiosity.

    <h2 class="text-3xl mt-8 mb-4 font-semibold">Why I Built This</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      In an era of algorithmic recommendations and endless scroll, I wanted to create something more
      intentional — a personal space where quality trumps quantity. This isn't just a list; it's a
      reflection of my journey through different forms of media and art.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      Rather than relying on generic ratings or trending lists, these are my genuine recommendations
      based on personal experience. Whether you're looking for your next great read, a weekend
      movie, or a new podcast to discover, I hope you'll find something here that speaks to you too.

    <p class="mb-4">
      This site began as a demo showcasing <a

        class="text-orange-400 hover:underline">Astro's</a
      > capabilities with the <a

        target="_blank"
        class="text-orange-400 hover:underline">Shared Element Transition API</a
      >, originally built by <a

        target="_blank"
        class="text-orange-400 hover:underline">Maxi Ferreira</a
      > for movies and TV shows using the <a

        target="_blank"
        class="text-orange-400 hover:underline">TMDb API</a
      >. I've since expanded and transformed it into something much more personal and comprehensive.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The project serves a dual purpose: it's both a learning exercise in working with existing
      codebases (a common real-world scenario for developers) and a platform for sharing genuine
      recommendations with the community.
